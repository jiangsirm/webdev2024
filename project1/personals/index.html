                    <h2>Freudian Interpretation of Bloodborne</h2>
                    <p>
                        <a href="../media/Bloodborne_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">This</a> piece of work is an attempt to reimagine the design of the game of Bloodborne from a Freudian psycho-analysis perspective.
                        It attempts to provide a interpretation that "hunter" and "the beast" are actually manifestation of ego and ed; the grotesque, morbid beast and the rational, steady hunter could originates from the same origin.

                        I have always been interested in the story-telling techniques employed in generations of video games, and some of them have created perfectly serious narratives that is akin to a novel. Moreover, different genres of video game is analogous to different genres of those traditional and well-establised form of art.
                        Thus, I think video game definitly have the potential of becoming a novel form of stoty-telling artwork.

                    <p>
                        I am a popping dancer, and I started popping since 2010.

                        Popping is a style of dance that is developed in the 70-80's influenced and accompanied by the flourish of Funky music. It has three foundaitons, according to one of its founding groups, i.e. pop, wave, and rolling. 
                        Building upon these foundations, there are different styles in the popping, e.g. animation and robot-like kind of dance are two widespread examples.

                        Popping and Funky music gives hand in hand with each other.<br>
