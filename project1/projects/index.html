                    <h2>Password Manager Applcation</h2>
                    <p>
                        This <a href="https://final-project-3-rfi8.onrender.com" target="_blank">project</a> is dynamic web application, created using React.js and Express.js with MongoDB connectivity. 
                        This application provides basic session tracking functionality via the use of encrypted cookies; core funtionalities allow an user to log in, log out, edit and update password, and send request to other user to share pass words
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This application also supports cryptographically secure password generation using the built-in library of node:crypto. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This application is a team effort, where I implemented the server-side logic for handling api calls, the front-end core logic of account page, and the database accessibility logics.
                        The styling is implemented by my teammate.

                    <h2>Conway's Game of Life Simulation</h2>
                    <p>
                        This <a href="https://yuchen-jiang-project2.onrender.com" target="_blank">project</a> is a static web development project, created using React.js. 
                        The main simulation is realized via use of react hooks; and the cell randomization algorithm is implemented in a way to enable clustered cell creation with a spawn rate of 5% in average.
                        The unlike some other implementation of Conway's game of life, the border are fixed, meaning that it may stop to evolve thereafter if a pattern touches the border.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another feature of this application is the functionality of displaying a heatmap for cell simluation, representing the most recent living cells by degrees.

                    <h2>Yijing Divination Program</h2>
                    <p>
                        This <a href="https://github.com/jiangsirm/YijingDivination/tree/main/divinationJavaFX" target="_blank">project</a> is an OOD design aim to replicate the process of making divination via Yijing Hexagrams.
                        Hexagram are symbols like ䷁ or ䷭. In order to get a divination, the user is expected to primarily use the string method, i.e. input a word or couple words of their choice.
                        Then program would parse the input, interpret the input while translating it into numbers, and then find the corresponding hexagrams via the help of a Hashmap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, per this specific methodology I have learnt and used, time also plays an important part of the divination; thus, the program would also fetch the time, more specifically, the hour, when the divination is made when interpreting the input.
                        As a result, entering the same string at different times would provide you with different kind of result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially, the program only accepts English letters as valid input; recently, I have found a way to make the program compatible with Chinese characters, specifically refer to characters emcompassed in the CJK Unified Ideographs block of unicode characters.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This <a href="https://github.com/jiangsirm/5004ExtraCredits/tree/jyc/ExtraCredits" target="_blank">project</a> is a team project, where I am in charge of the writting the controller and the actual interface. JavaFX seems to share a similar syntax with html.
                        The data are stored in a csv file for the time's sake, which could be further improved via using a actual database. Nonetheless, this trivial program support task adding, marking for completion, and sorting features.
